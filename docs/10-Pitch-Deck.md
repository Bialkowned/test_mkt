## Slide 1: Cover

### Visual

- Tagline: "On-Demand Software Testing Marketplace"
- Background: Clean gradient or abstract testing imagery

### Content
```
PeerTest Hub
On-Demand Software Testing Marketplace

[Your Name], CEO
[Co-founder Name], CTO
[Email]
[Date]

Raising: $500K Seed
```

### Speaker Notes
"Hi, I'm [Name], and this is PeerTest Hub. We're building the Uber of software testing—connecting companies who need QA testing with qualified testers worldwide through a secure escrow marketplace."

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Visual
- Split screen showing frustrated developer and bugs

### Content
```
Software Testing is Broken

For Companies:
❌ Hiring QA engineers: $80K+/year + benefits
❌ Agencies: $5,000-$15,000 per project
❌ Freelancers: Inconsistent quality
❌ Limited devices: Can't test iOS, Android, all browsers
❌ Slow turnaround: Weeks for comprehensive testing

For Testers:
❌ Hard to find consistent work
❌ Payment disputes on generic platforms
❌ No specialized QA marketplace
❌ Unclear career path

Result: Buggy software, delayed launches, frustrated users
```

### Speaker Notes
"Every software company faces this dilemma: You need testing, but hiring is expensive and slow. Agencies cost thousands. Freelancers are a gamble. Meanwhile, talented testers can't find steady, well-paying work in their specialty."

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### Visual
- Platform screenshot showing job marketplace

### Content
```
PeerTest Hub: The Modern Testing Marketplace

✅ Pre-vetted testers ready to work
✅ Pay per job, not per month
✅ Escrow protection guarantees quality
✅ Test on any device, any browser
✅ Results in 24-48 hours
✅ 70% cheaper than hiring

How it Works:
1. Client posts job ($50-$200)
2. Tester claims and tests (24-48h)
3. Client reviews submission
4. Payment released via escrow
```

### Speaker Notes
"PeerTest Hub solves this. Companies post testing jobs, qualified testers claim them, and our escrow system ensures both sides are protected. You get professional testing in 24-48 hours for a fraction of the cost of hiring or agencies."

---

## Slide 4: Product Demo

### Speaker Notes

$15B Global Software Testing Market

TAM: $15B (Global software testing)
SAM: $1.5B (10-500 employee companies, web/mobile)
SOM: $15M (Target 1% in 3 years)

Market Trends:
📈 10% annual growth
🚀 Agile/DevOps adoption = more testing
🌍 Remote work normalizes distributed teams
💰 Cost optimization drives on-demand services
📱 Mobile app explosion = device testing demand

65% of companies plan to increase testing budgets
```

### Speaker Notes
"This is a massive, growing market. Software testing is a $15 billion industry globally. We're targeting small to mid-size tech companies—a $1.5 billion segment that's underserved by expensive agencies and lacks good on-demand options."

Multiple Revenue Streams

1. Platform Fees (70% of revenue)
   • 15% commission on all jobs
   • $100 job = $15 to us, $85 to tester
   • Scalable with volume

2. Subscriptions (25% of revenue)
   • Starter: Free (5 jobs/month)
   • Pro: $49/month (unlimited, AI features)
   • Team: $199/month (20 members, collaboration)
